        "Understanding how and why we are here is one of the fundamental questions for the ages. Part of the answer to this question lies in the origins of galaxies, such as our own Milky Way. Yet questions remain about how the Milky Way (or any of the other ~100 billion galaxies in our Universe) was formed and has evolved. Galaxies come in all shapes, sizes and colors: from beautiful spirals to huge ellipticals. “Kevin Schawinski, previously an astrophysicist at Oxford University and co-founder of Galaxy Zoo, described the problem that led to Galaxy Zoo's creation when he was set the task of classifying the morphology of more than 900,000 galaxies by eye that had been imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA.”"
